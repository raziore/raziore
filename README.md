(Updated on Mar.30 2024)

I changed the service provider on 2023.1.2, from Glitch to Netlify, it sped up significantly. I guess this is because they are on a update with Fastly. After the update, it sped up again, till now. Anyhow, I decide to use Netlify as my main constructor.

I'm writing my blogs, and there're already many posts I've decided to write. I'm also on a check for the update of my own personal page.

You really need to know that I'm a very casual person, so is my website. When I want to update it, it is updated. When I don't, (￣_,￣ ). Partially it is becuz my study, but I must confess I'm not eager enough to make it.

# What is this

# Notice

I'm on campus and I'm in a very important semester for me. This repo won't update frequently for one year.
