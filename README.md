# Preface

Fine, I finally decided to write the introduction.(*/ω＼*)

I'm not familiar with the MarkDown language, so the first version I'll paste on directly.

I changed the service provider just one day before(2023.1.2), from Glitch to Netlify, it sped up significantly.

I'm writing my first blog, and there're already many posts I've decided to write.

I want you to know that I'm a very casual person, so is my website. When I want to update it, it is updated. When I don't, (￣_,￣ ).

# What is this

My blog on netlify is linked to this repo for continuous development.[Visit My Blog→](https://ocarno.netlify.app/)

# Notice

I'm on campus and, soon there'll be final exams. This repo won't update frequently recently.
